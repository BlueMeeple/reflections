What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates hidden files to track the state and history of the dir.
	Without these files, it would be impossible to know which dirs were under
	source control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area contains more info that the WD, because it expresses the
	intent to commit.
	Changes in the staging area are not yet committed to the repo. This means
	they can be undone with no effect on the repo, and commits that will
	ultimately be done transactionally can be assembled piece by piece.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	You can review all changes together before committing.
